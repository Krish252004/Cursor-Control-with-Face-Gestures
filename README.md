# Cursor Control with Face Gestures
This project implements a hands-free cursor control system that leverages deep learning and artificial neural networks to interpret facial gestures. Designed to improve accessibility and offer an alternative way to interact with a computer, this system allows users to control the cursor through simple head movements and facial expressions.

# Key Features:
# Face Gesture Recognition: 
Detects and interprets various facial gestures to control cursor movements, such as moving the cursor left, right, up, or down, and performing clicks.
# Deep Learning Models: 
Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for real-time face tracking and gesture recognition, ensuring high accuracy and responsiveness.
# Artificial Neural Networks:
Employed to process and classify the detected gestures, translating them into precise cursor movements.
# Technologies Used:
# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 
Used for face detection and tracking, providing the foundation for gesture recognition.
# Python & OpenCV: 
Core tools for implementing the system, with OpenCV handling image processing and Python managing the deep learning models.
# TensorFlow/PyTorch:
Frameworks used for building and training the neural networks.
# Applications:
# Accessibility: 
Provides an alternative input method for users with physical disabilities, enabling them to control the computer without using hands.
# Innovative User Interaction: 
Offers a novel way to interact with a computer, which could be integrated into various user interface systems or gaming environments.
